    text: If you choose to wear a mask, then- 1. Before touching the mask, clean hands
      with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water 2. Take the mask and inspect
      it for tears or holes. 3. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal
      strip is). 4. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured
      side). 5. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of
      the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose. 6. Pull down the mask’s bottom
      so it covers your mouth and your chin. 7. Do not touch the mask while you are
      wearing it for protection. 8. After use, take off the mask with clean hands;
      remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from
      your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of
      the mask. 9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use. Do not
      reuse the mask. 10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask
      – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap
      and water.
  utter_prevention:
  - text: 1. Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and
      is the best way to protect others and yourself. 2. When possible maintain at
      least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially important
      if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.. 3. Regularly and
      thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with
      soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based
      hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 4. Avoid going to crowded
      places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come
      into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to
      maintain physical distance of 1 metre. 5. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
      Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands
      can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can
      enter your body and infect you. 6. Make sure you, and the people around you,
      follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with
      your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used
      tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following
      good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such
      as cold, flu and COVID-19. 7. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing,
      seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow
      the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities
      will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling
      in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the
      right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of
      viruses and other infections. 8. Stay home and self-isolate even with minor
      symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone
      bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting
      others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possudo
  utter_sanitize_surface:
  - text: Coronavirus on surfaces can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants
      that will kill the virus.
  utter_spread:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads
      primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth,
      which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks.
